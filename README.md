## 🧪 Overview

This project covers end-to-end UI and API testing for DemoQA using WebdriverIO, TypeScript, Chai, and Allure reporting.  
It demonstrates advanced interaction with forms, widgets, alerts, frames, drag & drop areas, modal dialogs, and includes visual and video validation.

## ✅ Features Covered

### 🔹 UI Testing

- **Elements**: Checkboxes, text boxes, radio buttons, file upload/download, web tables.
- **Forms**: Randomized form filling, validation, modal verification.
- **Alerts, Frames & Windows**: JavaScript alerts, browser windows/tabs, nested frames, modals.
- **Widgets**: Auto-complete, sliders, progress bars, tooltips.
- **Interactions**: Draggable, droppable, selectable, sortable, resizable (with constraints and free).

### 🔹 API Testing

- Create new user
- Generate auth token
- Add book to user collection
- Validate and remove added book
- Cleanup created user

## 🎥 Video Recording

Tests automatically record `.mp4` files into `/video` directory.  
Useful for debugging flaky tests or UI issues.

---

## 🐳 Docker Usage

This project provides a Docker image with **Node.js + Google Chrome + (optional) Firefox + Java (for Allure CLI)** preinstalled.  
It allows you to run tests in a consistent environment locally or in CI/CD.

### Quick Start (recommended)

Build the image:

```bash
docker compose build
```

Run tests and generate the Allure report:

```bash
docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit
```

Tests will run inside the container.

The Allure report is always generated, even if tests fail.

The report is available on the host at:

```bash
./allure-report/index.html
```

The container exit code equals the test exit code.

## By default, the container exposes the report server on http://localhost:5050.
